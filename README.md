# IpLoggerFlood
Sends a lot of requests to a IP Logger link to fill it with false information (NOT A DDOS/DOS SCRIPT)  
# Uses
THIS IS NOT TO BE USED AS A DDoS/DoS Script. These requests will not overwhelm even the weakest systems.  
This is to troll booters that send ip logger links with intentions to grab your IP Address.  
Also, please don't use this on random sites, this is only intended for IP loggers!  
# Credits
