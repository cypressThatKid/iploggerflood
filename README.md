<h1>IpLoggerFlood</h1>
<p>Sends a lot of requests to a IP Logger link to fill it with false information (NOT A DDOS/DOS SCRIPT)</p>
<p>
<h1>Uses</h1>
THIS IS NOT TO BE USED AS A DDoS/DoS Script. These requests will not overwhelm even the weakest systems.
<p>
This is to troll booters that send ip logger links with intentions to grab your IP Address.
<p>
Also, please don't use this on random sites, this is only intended for IP loggers!
