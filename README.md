<h1>IpLoggerFlood</h1>
<p>Sends a lot of requests to a IP Logger link to fill it with false information (NOT A DDOS/DOS SCRIPT)</p>
<p>
<h1>Uses</h1>
THIS IS NOT TO BE USED AS A DDoS/DoS Script. These requests will not overwhelm even the weakest systems.
<p>
All These requests will do is fill up the logs to mess with whatever malicious actions the person was trying to do that sent the link.
<p>
It's late so I will continue README later, but GLHF!!
